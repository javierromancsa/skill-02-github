## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Javier Roman Sanchez**, a Sr.Cloud Architect based in San Antonio. I specialize in designing scalable, secure, and high-performance cloud solutions that empower businesses to innovate with confidence.

### ☁️ What I Do
I architect cloud-native systems that solve complex problems—from modernizing legacy infrastructure to enabling AI-driven insights. My work spans multi-cloud environments, automation pipelines, and everything in between.

### 🧠 My Philosophy
> “A great cloud architecture is like a symphony—every service, every function, every container plays its part in harmony.”

### 🛠️ Favorite Tools
- Azure, AWS, GCP
- Terraform, Bicep
- Kubernetes, Docker
- GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines

### 🌮 Fun Fact
I once built a cloud-native app that predicted breakfast tacos locations in San Antonio using weather data and social media trends. It wasn’t just useful—it was delicious.
